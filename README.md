# Calculator

# About
The following program is a calculator made by using Javascript and HTML. As you notice there is no CSS as it is not needed. I have also put the html and the javascript into one code. I just do this to make it easier however if you want to make it into two seperate files that is fine as long as you reference it.

# How it works
The program is quite simple. When you open it will ask the user for two inputs. From there the user will be able to choose what kind of results that want such as the sum, difference, product, quotient or average. If you look in the code each of those results has its own function. Once the button is clicked it will perform that operation. To see that it has worked it will show you an alert from the webpage giving you the correct asnwer.

# Extra
The program is like I said very simple. Of course there are many ways to make it even more interesting. You could add more inputs or have it find the reminder as well. This code is an excellent starting point.
